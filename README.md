# Against The Storm Modding Tools

This mod activates Experimental Mode. 
Great if you run on GOG version or can't be bothered to flip the switch in Steam settings.
Useful because you have access to the console (use the **`** key) and because you'll use separate saves from your 'main' game so you don't mess up your progress just because you test mods.

Furthermore there's two hotkeys that might be useful while developing:
* **Ctrl+N** instantly forwards to the next season (equivalent to `season.next`)
* **Ctrl+Alt+F1** to dump some info about all Perks (called effects, includes cornerstones and trader/ruin rewards) to log (default log location is likely `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Eremite Games\Against the Storm`). Information is in the form `name || ("Display Name") uses icon ICON_NAME"`
